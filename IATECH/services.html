      IATECH service and support start at the very beginning of a project and continue through the lifecycle of your automation system. Project execution improves with a better design concept defined early in the project. With IATECH as a part of your team, you can count on a partner who will add value by balancing the technical needs of your project with your financial requirements. IATECH is focused on providing valuable assistance in the front end engineering design of projects for the process automation industry.

    <p style="text-align:justify; line-height:1.6;">
      Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) is a broad-encompassing term that includes all engineering design activities for your project. By breaking these activities out and executing them earlier in the project, you can take advantage of better scope definition to reduce risk, and therefore the cost, associated with your project. Once the FEED Study is completed, you can then decide on a strategy for implementing a project. You might decide to execute your project as a typical capital investment project, or you may consider the option of including the project as a component of a vendor Technical Support Agreement. IATECH professionals will work with you to help you make the decision that will best fit your automation solutions plan and budget.
